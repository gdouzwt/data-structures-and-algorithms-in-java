# 1.10 Exercises
### Reinforcement
R-1.1 Write a short Java method, `inputAllBaseTypes`, that inputs a different value of each base type from the standard 
input device and prints it back to the standard output device.  
R-1.2 Suppose that we create an array `A` of `GameEntry` objects, which has an integer `scores` field, and we clone `A` and 
store the result in an array `B`. If we then immediately set `A[4].scores` equal to 550, what is the score value of the 
`GameEntry` object referenced by `B[4]`?
