# 1.10 Exercises
### Reinforcement
**R-1.1** Write a short Java method, `inputAllBaseTypes`, that inputs a different value of each base type from the standard 
input device and prints it back to the standard output device.  
**R-1.2** Suppose that we create an array `A` of `GameEntry` objects, which has an integer `scores` field, and we clone `A` and 
store the result in an array `B`. If we then immediately set `A[4].scores` equal to 550, what is the score value of the 
`GameEntry` object referenced by `B[4]`?  
**R-1.3** Write a short Java method, `isMultiple`, that takes two `long` values, *n* and *m*, and returns true if and only if *n* is a multiple of *m*, that is, $n = mi$ for some integer *i*.  
**R-1.4** Write a short Java method, `isEven`, that takes an int i and returns true if and only if i is even. Your method cannot use the multiplication, modulus, or division operators, however.  
**R-1.5** Write a short Java method that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all positive integers less than or equal to n.  
**R-1.6** Write a short Java method that takes an integer n and returns the sum of  all the odd positive integers less than or equal to n.  
**R-1.7** Write a short Java method that takes an integer n and returns the sum of the squares of all positive integers less than or equal to n.  
**R-1.8** Write a short Java method that counts the number of vowel in a given character string.  
**R-1.9** Write a short Java method that uses a `StringBuilder` instance to remove all the punctuation from a string s storing a sentence, for example, transforming the string "Let's try, Mike!" to "Lets try Mike".  
**R-1.10** Write a Java class, Flower, that has three instance variables of type String, int, and float, which respectively represent the name of the flower, its number of petals, and price. Your class must include a constructor method that initializes each variable to an appropriate value, and your class should include methods for setting the value of each type, and getting the value of each type.
